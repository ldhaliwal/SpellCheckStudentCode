| September 24 | 8:55-9:25am |                       Talked through how to approach the problem, came up with an idea about how to represent the dictionary as a tree for easier lookups. also to condense the inputted text into just one instance of each word to also reduce look ups. |
| September 24 |  9-9:40pm   |                                            Wrote out some pseudocode based on what i talked about in class, did some research on other type of trees in CS and came across a data structure called a Trie, looks promising but I hate the way its spelled. |
| September 25 |    2-3pm    |  Talked with kate and sierra about possible approaches, wrote the method to consense the text into only 1 instance of each word which worked. still very confused with how to write the main part that simplifies that dictionary to make quicker lookups. |
