| September 24 | 8:55-9:25am |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Talked through how to approach the problem, came up with an idea about how to represent the dictionary as a tree for easier lookups. also to condense the inputted text into just one instance of each word to also reduce look ups. |
| September 24 |  9-9:40pm   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Wrote out some pseudocode based on what i talked about in class, did some research on other type of trees in CS and came across a data structure called a Trie, looks promising but I hate the way its spelled. |
| September 25 |    2-3pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Talked with kate and sierra about possible approaches, wrote the method to consense the text into only 1 instance of each word which worked. still very confused with how to write the main part that simplifies that dictionary to make quicker lookups. |

Started writing out code for dictionary storage. |
| September 26 | 12:30-12:55 | Finished my hashset code and started running tests. I passes the poem and sentence ones no problem, but failed the other three. I wanted to check if I was getting the wrong answer or just timing out so I had each print the number of misspelled words in the final array, and it matched the number from each of the answer text files which is a good sign. That says to me that it's doing the right thing, but just taking too long, so i guess the answer from class on friday will fix that. |
