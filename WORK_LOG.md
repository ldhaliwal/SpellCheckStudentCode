| September 24 |  8:55-9:25am  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Talked through how to approach the problem, came up with an idea about how to represent the dictionary as a tree for easier lookups. also to condense the inputted text into just one instance of each word to also reduce look ups. |
| September 24 |   9-9:40pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Wrote out some pseudocode based on what i talked about in class, did some research on other type of trees in CS and came across a data structure called a Trie, looks promising but I hate the way its spelled. |
| September 25 |     2-3pm     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Talked with kate and sierra about possible approaches, wrote the method to consense the text into only 1 instance of each word which worked. still very confused with how to write the main part that simplifies that dictionary to make quicker lookups. |
| September 25 |   8-8:30pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Looked more at the idea of using hashsets to store dictionary for constant lookup times, and thought it was worth trying. Started writing out code for dictionary storage. |
| September 26 |  12:30-12:55  | Finished my hashset code and started running tests. I passes the poem and sentence ones no problem, but failed the other three. I wanted to check if I was getting the wrong answer or just timing out so I had each print the number of misspelled words in the final array, and it matched the number from each of the answer text files which is a good sign. That says to me that it's doing the right thing, but just taking too long, so i guess the answer from class on friday will fix that. |

| October 3    |   9-9:55am    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Almost finished my trie solution, condensing the text definitely takes too long so  I'm taking that out. Also changing to use a trie and an arraylist to track the misspelled words for faster lookups. |
| October 6    |     3-4pm     |                                           finished the Trie solution and wrote the TST solution. both are getting the right answers but are timing out (at least for most of them). I did my TST insert and lookup methods recursively, and I'm thinking maybe that has something to do with why its taking too long. I also think it may be my computer? I ran first with all my other applications open, and 3/5 timed out and then again everything except intelliJ closed and only 1/5 timed out. |
